Data analysis of the how different demographics have access to home mortgage loans

**Background**

How accessible is housing in Louisville? That is a important way to evaluate the economic health of the area. To help answer this question we will be using CSVs data from Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We will use that infomation to compare home ownership across demographics to find what the average home owner profile is.  Some features we will use are:

  1. Create a Google Colab notebook use as the environment for the project
  2. Read in data from a download CSV file
  3. Use pandas and other built in functions to clean data
  4. Extract and analyze the data to be evaluate
  5. Create visuals for display the data
  6. Decribe the code uisng markdown language
  7. Summary and final analysis

**Data**
